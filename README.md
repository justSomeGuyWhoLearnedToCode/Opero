Job Website 

This is a site I wrote ~90% of the code for as part of a project in a web programming course. It's built in the hopes of relieving some of the stress of searching for a job and is designed to aggregate jobs from every job site that has an API.

It's fairly WYSIWYG inasmuch as a job seeker enters a query, and the engine spits out a list of results according to the job seeker's needs. The results page isn't functioning as the API and db interactivity is limited due to my removal of some of the mySQL verification and Oath key codes which are (obviously) private and reserved for individual members of the site to employ (ha).  

I'll eventually update it with more API's, but for now it's a work in progress.
