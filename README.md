Job Website 

This is a site I wrote >90% of the code for as part of a project in a web programming course. 

It's fairly WYSIWYG inasmuch as a job seeker enters a query, and the engine spits out a list of results according to the job seeker's needs.

I'll eventually update it with more API's, but for now it's something that is a work in progress.
